Version 0.89 BETA
Released 8/20/2022
Maze Collections: MHPE 13720 08032022

Fixes:

1. Fixed issue where killing Maxoid was not awarding points
2. I *think* I fixed a bug where collisions between Max and Pyroids where not working after one Max has been killed.
3. Found another bug that was causing random 'fast shots' in the Star Castle battle
4. Fixed Vaxx mainframe graphics that had mis-aligned vectors.
5. Fixed issue where playing level 28/lastXX in Demo mode would continue to 'level 29' rather than resetting back to Level 1 and tokens were retained which caused weird levels.
6. Fixed issue where Red key would not be carried over to the final space station section
7. Fixed issue where doors placed at far left of screen would not be hidden (was issue on level 23)

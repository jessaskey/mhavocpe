Fixes:

1. Fixed bug where all warps could be intialized with all zeros with a corrupt EEROM

3. Added more Rex speech when first being activated and being killed
4. Added intial background sound for Star Castle fight scene
5. Added Random WooHoo from Rex after exiting space station
6. Fixed weird issue where Rex was not quite touching Reactor in attract mode animation, don't know what caused this timing to change!
7. Added random 'better hurry' from Rex at 15 seconds left in maze
8. Self Test now shows physical DIP switch settings on 0/1 inputs screen which is better than showing the settings in EEROM
9. Fixed issue where Flyboids were all gone after first death and level would run indefinitely (bug from last release)
10. Star Castle enemies and station flicker when player ship dies.
11. Star Castle fireball is slower and won't fire if player ship is exploding.
12. Replaced all text of 'Mothership' with 'Mainframe' to be consistent with Jerky maze hints.
13. Builds are sometimes generating with incorect TEXT files for the language/edition

Known Bugs:

1. Need to fix all MOTHER speech and make consistent. ALL speech is still draft/temp.
2. Hidden Transporter is mysteriously remaining after dying on Level 22 (final station #2) and restarting on Level 21 (final station #1)

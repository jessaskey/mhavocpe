Verstion 0.87 BETA
Released 7/21/2022
Maze Collections: MHPE 13720 07202022 069

Fixes:

1. Fixed return level from first two tesser levels in PE
2. Fixed issue with missing fishoids on Level 9
3. Fixed crash when entering transporter on Level 21
4. Changed BALL motion in tact to be a different X starting position instead of a different X velocity. This will make the ball(s) travel consitently.
5. Fixed issue with Tesseract data not saving correctly in EEROM and causing score resets after ST.
6. Added updated speech for 10-1 countdown in ADPCM ROM (I removed the STUNN Runner speech that was here forever).

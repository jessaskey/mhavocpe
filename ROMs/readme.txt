This folder contains information about the ROM's for Major Havoc - The Promised End

There are *alot* of files here and I have recently reorganized them to better align with HBMAME

The folders match the HMMAME driver that uses them

Folders with an X in them... mhavocpex... are pre-release ROMs... mhavocpex1 is the oldest and mhavocpex8 is the last pre-release
Folders without an X... mhavocpe... are 'done/release' ROM's... mhavocpe is the first release of the ROM's that are in a finished state

If there are bug releases after the first mail release, then they will get additional suffixes as well... mhavocpe1, mhavocpe2, etc

Inside each folder are release notes (when available) as well as many flavors of that release since there are different languages and different sound encodings
for either LPC (TMS5220) or ADPCM (OKIM6295) speech.

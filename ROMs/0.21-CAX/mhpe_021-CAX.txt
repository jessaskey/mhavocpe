Changes in this version:

1. Added some MAX robots to Level 18 as a teaser.
2. Added code to skip up to Level 25 (star castle) after level 19 is completed so players don't need to go through blank maze levels (20-24).
3. Added code after Star Castle to jump directly into CAX animation
4. Added code to show message after CAX animation that final maze is next, then homeworld.

** Current issues are listed here - https://github.com/jessaskey/mhavocpe/issues

This is the FULL source code for Major Havoc - The Promised End. There are tools and scripts included in this folder so that YOU
can compile the source into BINARY ROM images using the TASMx compiler and optionally using TASM-IDE (which is a seperate GitHub public repository) 
which gives you a more UI based compilation experience. 

I will attempt to update this page with more information on specific steps for compilation. If there are volunteers that are interested in this or would like to assist,
please contact me jess@askey.org. 

Keep playing the homeworld is near!

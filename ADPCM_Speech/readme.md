IF you are interested in making the speech samples included in the .x1 ROM image better. Reach out to me and download this tool I made so you can put your own speech samples into the game...  https://github.com/jessaskey/MSM6295Loader 

I have these available for $90 + shipping, assembled and tested. Email jess@askey.org for more info.
